# HomeTempMonitorAPI
</hr>

The "HomeTempMonitor" repository is a home automation web service that allows you to store and retrieve temperature data from different rooms of your house. With this service, you can easily build an API that your temperature sensors can send data to, and then retrieve or process the data as needed.

This project uses Flask, a Python-based web framework, to build a RESTful API that can receive and store incoming temperature data. The temperature data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing and processing large amounts of data.

With this repository, you can learn how to build a simple Flask API using PostgreSQL for data storage. You will also gain experience working with RESTful APIs, which are a common way to exchange data between web applications.

This project does not include Arduinos, but it provides a solid foundation for building home automation projects that involve temperature sensors. By building a home automation web service, you can easily monitor and track the temperature in different rooms of your house, helping you to maintain a comfortable living environment.

The code in this repository is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in building their own home automation projects using Flask and PostgreSQL.
